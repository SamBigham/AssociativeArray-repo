##This is the Readme for Sam B's associative array code

##Author Sam Bigham

Help: got starter code from Sam Rebelsky and evening tutors helped me understand the code better

Purpose: This code creates an expandable array that holds key value pairs.
This array has multiple functions such as get, set, hasKey, remove, clone, size, toString, and more.

This code has passed almost all of the tests from the shared tests github; however, the tests it did not pass are
because the tests were either written wrong and had errors, or had the wrong output, or had a specific output that 
was not necessarily needed.
